abstract: Previous studies have shown that information held in visual working memory
  is represented in the occipital, parietal, and frontal cortices. However, less is
  known about whether the mnemonic information of multi-feature objects is modulated
  by task demand in the parietal and frontal regions. To address this question, we
  asked participants to remember either color or orientation of one of the two colored
  gratings for a delay. Using fMRI and an inverted encoding model, we reconstructed
  population-level, feature-selective responses in the occipital, parietal and frontal
  cortices during memory maintenance. We found that not only orientation but also
  color information can be maintained in higher-order parietal and frontal cortices
  as well as the early visual cortex when it was cued to be remembered. Conversely,
  neither the task-irrelevant feature of the cued object, nor any feature of the uncued
  object was maintained in the occipital, parietal, or frontal cortices. These results
  suggest a highly selective mechanism of visual working memory that maintains task-relevant
  features only.
