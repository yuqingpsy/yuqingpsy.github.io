abstract: Stimulus location is not always informative during visual short-term memory
  (VSTM) for nonspatial features. Nevertheless, there is considerable evidence for
  the automatic encoding and retention of location information, regardless of its
  task relevance. To explore the functional and neural bases of the representation
  of spatial context in VSTM for nonspatial information, functional magnetic resonance
  imaging was performed while subjects performed delayed recall for the orientation
  of individual stimuli. Stimulus location varied across trials, and although this
  information was irrelevant for task performance, multivariate pattern analysis decoding
  of stimulus location sustained across trials, and also the decoding strength, predicted
  the precision of the recall of orientation. The influence of spatial context on
  the representation of orientation was operationalized by comparing the orientation
  reconstructions with multivariate inverted encoding models (IEM) trained in location
  context-dependent vs. -independent data. Although orientation reconstructions were
  robust for both location-dependent and location-independent IEMs, they were markedly
  stronger for the former. Furthermore, the functional relevance of location context
  was demonstrated by the fact that only the location-dependent neural representations
  of stimulus orientation predicted recall precision. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Neural representation
  strength of stimulus location predicts the precision of visual short-term memory
  (VSTM) recall of nonspatial stimulus, even when this information is task irrelevant.
  Neural representations of nonspatial stimuli that incorporate location context are
  stronger than those that do not, and only the former representations are strongly
  linked to behavior. The contributions to nonspatial VSTM performance of the representation
  of location context are at least partly distinct from those of the representation
  of stimulus content.
