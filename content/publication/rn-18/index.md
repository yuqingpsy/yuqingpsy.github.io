abstract: Successful goal-directed behavior requires the maintenance and implementation
  of abstract task goals on concrete stimulus information in working memory. Previous
  working memory research has revealed distributed neural representations of task
  information across cortex. However, how the distributed task representations emerge
  and communicate with stimulus-specific information to implement flexible goal-directed
  computations is still unclear. Here, leveraging electroencephalography (EEG) and
  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in human participants along with state
  space analyses, we provided converging evidence in support of a low-dimensional
  neural geometry of goal information congruent with a designed task space, which
  first emerged in frontal cortex during goal maintenance and then transferred to
  posterior cortex through frontomedial-to-posterior theta coherence for implementation
  on stimulus-specific representations. Importantly, the fidelity of the goal geometry
  was associated with memory performance. Collectively, our findings suggest that
  abstract goals in working memory are represented in an organized, task-congruent
  neural geometry for communications from frontal to posterior cortex to enable computations
  necessary for goal-directed behaviors.
