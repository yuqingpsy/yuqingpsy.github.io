abstract: 'Visual imagery allows for the construction of rich internal experience
  in our mental world. However, it has remained poorly understood how imagery experience
  derives volitionally as opposed to being cue driven. Here, using electroencephalography
  and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we systematically investigate the spatiotemporal
  dynamics of self-generated imagery by having participants volitionally imagining
  one of the orientations from a learned pool. We contrast self-generated imagery
  with cue-induced imagery, where participants imagined line orientations based on
  associative cues acquired previously. Our results reveal overlapping neural signatures
  of cue-induced and self-generated imagery. Yet, these neural signatures display
  substantially differential sensitivities to the two types of imagery: self-generated
  imagery is supported by an enhanced involvement of the anterior cortex in representing
  imagery contents. By contrast, cue-induced imagery is supported by enhanced imagery
  representations in the posterior visual cortex. These results jointly support a
  reverse cortical hierarchy in generating and maintaining imagery contents in self-generated
  versus externally cued imagery.'
