abstract: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the
  neural codes for representing stimulus information held in different states of priority
  in working memory. Human participants (male and female) performed delayed recall
  for 2 oriented gratings that could appear in any of several locations. Priority
  status was manipulated by a retrocue, such that one became the prioritized memory
  item (PMI) and another the unprioritized memory item (UMI). Using inverted encoding
  models (IEMs), we found that, in early visual cortex, the orientation of the UMI
  was represented in a neural representation that was rotated relative to the PMI.
  In intraparietal sulcus (IPS), we observed the analogous effect for the representation
  of the location of the UMI. Taken together, these results provide evidence for a
  common remapping mechanism that may be responsible for representing stimulus identity
  and stimulus context with different levels of priority in working memory.
