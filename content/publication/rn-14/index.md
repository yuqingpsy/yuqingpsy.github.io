abstract: 'Humans constantly receive massive amounts of information, both perceived
  from the external environment and imagined from the internal world. To function
  properly, the brain needs to correctly identify the origin of information being
  processed. Recent work has suggested common neural substrates for perception and
  imagery. However, it has remained unclear how the brain differentiates between external
  and internal experiences with shared neural codes. Here we tested this question
  in human participants (male and female) by systematically investigating the neural
  processes underlying the generation and maintenance of visual information from voluntary
  imagery, veridical perception, and illusion. The inclusion of illusion allowed us
  to differentiate between objective and subjective internality: while illusion has
  an objectively internal origin and can be viewed as involuntary imagery, it is also
  subjectively perceived as having an external origin like perception. Combining fMRI,
  eye-tracking, multivariate decoding, and encoding approaches, we observed superior
  orientation representations in parietal cortex during imagery compared with perception,
  and conversely in early visual cortex. This imagery dominance gradually developed
  along a posterior-to-anterior cortical hierarchy from early visual to parietal cortex,
  emerged in the early epoch of imagery and sustained into the delay epoch, and persisted
  across varied imagined contents. Moreover, representational strength of illusion
  was more comparable to imagery in early visual cortex, but more comparable to perception
  in parietal cortex, suggesting content-specific representations in parietal cortex
  differentiate between subjectively internal and external experiences, as opposed
  to early visual cortex. These findings together support a domain-general engagement
  of parietal cortex in internally generated experience.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT How
  does the brain differentiate between imagined and perceived experiences? Combining
  fMRI, eye-tracking, multivariate decoding, and encoding approaches, the current
  study revealed enhanced stimulus-specific representations in visual imagery originating
  from parietal cortex, supporting the subjective experience of imagery. This neural
  principle was further validated by evidence from visual illusion, wherein illusion
  resembled perception and imagery at different levels of cortical hierarchy. Our
  findings provide direct evidence for the critical role of parietal cortex as a domain-general
  region for content-specific imagery, and offer new insights into the neural mechanisms
  underlying the differentiation between subjectively internal and external experiences.'
