abstract: 'Previous working memory research has demonstrated robust stimulus representations
  during memory maintenance in both voltage and alpha-band activity in electroencephalography.
  However, the exact functions of these 2 neural signatures have remained controversial.
  Here we systematically investigated their respective contributions to memory manipulation.
  Human participants either maintained a previously seen spatial location, or manipulated
  the location following a mental rotation cue over a delay. Using multivariate decoding,
  we observed robust location representations in low-frequency voltage and alpha-band
  oscillatory activity with distinct spatiotemporal dynamics: location representations
  were most evident in posterior channels in alpha-band activity, but were most prominent
  in the more anterior, central channels in voltage signals. Moreover, the temporal
  emergence of manipulated representation in central voltage preceded that in posterior
  alpha-band activity, suggesting that voltage might carry stimulus-specific source
  signals originated internally from anterior cortex, whereas alpha-band activity
  might reflect feedback signals in posterior cortex received from higher-order cortex.
  Lastly, while location representations in both signals were coded in a low-dimensional
  neural subspace, location representation in central voltage was higher-dimensional
  and underwent a representational transformation that exclusively predicted memory
  behavior. Together, these results highlight the crucial role of central voltage
  in working memory, and support functional distinctions between voltage and alpha-band
  activity.'
