abstract: Working memory is imprecise, and these imprecisions can be explained by
  the combined influences of random diffusive error and systematic drift toward a
  set of stable states (\"attractors\"). However, the neural correlates of diffusion
  and drift remain unknown. Here, we investigated how delay-period activity in frontal
  and parietal cortex, which is known to correlate with the decline in behavioral
  memory precision observed with increasing memory load, might relate to diffusion
  and drift. We analyzed data from an existing experiment in which subjects performed
  delayed recall for line orientation, at different loads, during functional magnetic
  resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. To quantify the influence of drift and diffusion,
  we modeled subjects' behavior using a discrete attractor model and calculated within-subject
  correlation between frontal and parietal delay-period activity and whole-trial estimates
  of drift and diffusion. We found that although increases in frontal and parietal
  activity were associated with increases in both diffusion and drift, diffusion explained
  the most variance in frontal and parietal delay-period activity. In comparison,
  a subsequent whole-brain regression analysis showed that drift, rather than diffusion,
  explained the most variance in delay-period activity in lateral occipital cortex.
  These results are consistent with a model of the differential recruitment of general
  frontoparietal mechanisms in response to diffusive noise and of stimulus-specific
  biases in occipital cortex.
