abstract: 'Successful retrieval of an item from visual working memory (VWM) often
  requires an associated representation of the trial-unique context in which that
  item was presented. In experiment 1, fMRI of 16 male and female humans replicated
  a previous dissociation of the effects of manipulating memory load in comparison
  to the effects of manipulating context binding, by comparing VWM for one oriented
  line versus for three lines individuated by their location versus for three \"heterogeneous\"
  items drawn from different categories (orientation, color, and luminance): delay-period
  fMRI signal in frontal cortex and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) was sensitive to stimulus
  homogeneity rather than to memory load per se. Additionally, inspection of behavioral
  performance revealed a broad range of individual differences in the probability
  of responses to nontargets (also known as \"swap errors\"), and a post hoc comparison
  of high swap-error versus low swap-error groups generated several intriguing results:
  at recall, high swap-error subjects were seen to represent both the orientation
  and the location of the probed item less strongly, and with less differentiation
  from nonprobed items, and delay-period signal in IPS predicted behavioral and neural
  correlates of context binding at recall. In experiment 2, which was a preregistered
  replication, the 27 male and female humans were grouped into low and high swap-error
  groups by median split, and the results were broadly consistent with experiment
  1. These results present a neural correlate of swap errors, and suggest that delay-period
  activity of the IPS may be more important for the operation of context binding than
  for representation per se of stimulus identity.'
