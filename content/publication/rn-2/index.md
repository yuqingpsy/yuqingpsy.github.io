abstract: A previous study by Williams et al. (2008) provided evidence for a novel
  form of feedback in the visual system, whereby peripheral information is contained
  in foveal retinotopic cortex. Beyond its possible implication for peripheral object
  recognition, few studies have examined the effect of a direct behavioral manipulation
  of the foveal feedback representation. To address this question, we measured participants'
  peripheral visual discrimination performance while modulating their foveal representation
  in a series of psychophysical experiments. On each trial, participants discriminated
  the identities of briefly presented novel, three-dimensional objects or the orientations
  of gratings in a peripheral location while fixating at the center. Besides the peripheral
  target, another stimulus (foil) was also presented and masked at the fovea. Our
  results showed that for objects, when the foveal foil that was identical to the
  peripheral target was presented 150 ms after the onset of the peripheral target,
  visual discrimination of the peripheral target was improved. This congruency effect
  occurred even though participants did not consciously perceive the foveal stimulus.
  No such effect was observed when the foveal foil was presented simultaneously with
  the peripheral target, or when the foil was presented in a parafoveal location.
  The foil effect in gratings was different from that in objects in terms of its effective
  timing and foveal specificity, suggesting that foveal feedback may be specific to
  high-level objects. These results indicate that modulating foveal information can
  affect individuals' ability to discriminate peripheral objects, suggesting a functional
  role of foveal representations in peripheral visual perception.
