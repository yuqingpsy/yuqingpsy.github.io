abstract: Working memory (WM) requires encoding stimulus identity and context (e.g.
  where or when stimuli were encountered). To explore the neural bases of the strategic
  control of context binding in WM, we acquired fMRI while subjects performed delayed
  recognition of 3 orientation patches presented serially and at different locations.
  The recognition probe was an orientation patch with a superimposed digit, and pretrial
  instructions directed subjects to respond according to its location (\"location-relevant\"),
  to the ordinal position corresponding to its digit (\"order-relevant\"), or to just
  its orientation (relative to all three samples; \"context-irrelevant\"). Delay period
  signal in PPC was greater for context-relevant than for \"context-irrelevant\" trials,
  and multivariate decoding revealed strong sensitivity to context binding requirements
  (relevant vs. \"irrelevant\") and to context domain (\"location-\" vs. \"order-relevant\")
  in both occipital cortex and PPC. At recognition, multivariate inverted encoding
  modeling revealed markedly different patterns in these 2 regions, suggesting different
  context-processing functions. In occipital cortex, an active representation of the
  location of each of the 3 samples was reinstated regardless of the trial type. The
  pattern in PPC, by contrast, suggested a trial type-dependent filtering of sample
  information. These results indicate that PPC exerts strategic control over the representation
  of stimulus context in visual WM.
