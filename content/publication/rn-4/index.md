abstract: 'Although the manipulation of load is popular in visual working memory research,
  many studies confound general attentional demands with context binding by drawing
  memoranda from the same stimulus category. In this fMRI study of human observers
  (both sexes), we created high- versus low-binding conditions, while holding load
  constant, by comparing trials requiring memory for the direction of motion of one
  random dot kinematogram (RDK; 1M trials) versus for three RDKs (3M), or versus one
  RDK and two color patches (1M2C). Memory precision was highest for 1M trials and
  comparable for 3M and 1M2C trials. And although delay-period activity in occipital
  cortex did not differ between the three conditions, returning to baseline for all
  three, multivariate pattern analysis decoding of a remembered RDK from occipital
  cortex was also highest for 1M trials and comparable for 3M and 1M2C trials. Delay-period
  activity in intraparietal sulcus (IPS), although elevated for all three conditions,
  displayed more sensitivity to demands on context binding than to load per se. The
  1M-to-3M increase in IPS signal predicted the 1M-to-3M declines in both behavioral
  and neural estimates of working memory precision. These effects strengthened along
  a caudal-to-rostral gradient, from IPS0 to IPS5. Context binding-independent load
  sensitivity was observed when analyses were lateralized and extended into PFC, with
  trend-level effects evident in left IPS and strong effects in left lateral PFC.
  These findings illustrate how visual working memory capacity limitations arise from
  multiple factors that each recruit dissociable brain systems.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
  Visual working memory capacity predicts performance on a wide array of cognitive
  and real-world outcomes. At least two theoretically distinct factors are proposed
  to influence visual working memory capacity limitations: an amodal attentional resource
  that must be shared across remembered items; and the demands on context binding.
  We unconfounded these two factors by varying load with items drawn from the same
  stimulus category (\"high demands on context binding\") versus items drawn from
  different stimulus categories (\"low demands on context binding\"). The results
  provide evidence for the dissociability, and the neural bases, of these two theorized
  factors, and they specify that the functions of intraparietal sulcus may relate
  more strongly to the control of representations than to the general allocation of
  attention.'
