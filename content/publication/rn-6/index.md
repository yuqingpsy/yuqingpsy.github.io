abstract: The respective roles of occipital, parietal, and frontal cortices in visual
  working memory maintenance have long been under debate. Previous work on whether
  parietal and frontal regions convey mnemonic information has yielded mixed findings.
  One possibility for this variability is that the mnemonic representations in high-level
  frontoparietal regions are modulated by attentional priority, such as temporal order.
  To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the most recent item, which has a higher
  attentional priority in terms of temporal order, is preferentially encoded in frontoparietal
  regions. On each trial, participants viewed 2 gratings with different orientations
  in succession, and were cued to remember one of them. Using fMRI and an inverted
  encoding model, we reconstructed population-level, orientation representations in
  occipital (V1-V3), parietal (IPS), and frontal (FEF) areas during memory maintenance.
  Unlike early visual cortex where robust orientation representations were observed
  regardless of serial order, parietal, and frontal cortices showed stronger representations
  when participants remembered the second grating. A subsequent experiment using a
  change detection task on color rings excluded the possibilities of residual stimulus-driven
  signals or motor preparative signals for responses. These results suggest that mnemonic
  representations in parietal and frontal cortices are modulated by temporal-order-based
  attentional priority signals.
