abstract: Humans can construct rich subjective experience even when no information
  is available in the external world. Here, we investigated the neural representation
  of purely internally generated stimulus-like information during visual working memory.
  Participants performed delayed recall of oriented gratings embedded in noise with
  varying contrast during fMRI scanning. Their trialwise behavioral responses provided
  an estimate of their mental representation of the to-be-reported orientation. We
  used multivariate inverted encoding models to reconstruct the neural representations
  of orientation in reference to the response. We found that response orientation
  could be successfully reconstructed from activity in early visual cortex, even on
  0% contrast trials when no orientation information was actually presented, suggesting
  the existence of a purely internally generated neural code in early visual cortex.
  In addition, cross-generalization and multidimensional scaling analyses demonstrated
  that information derived from internal sources was represented differently from
  typical working memory representations, which receive influences from both external
  and internal sources. Similar results were also observed in intraparietal sulcus,
  with slightly different cross-generalization patterns. These results suggest a potential
  mechanism for how externally driven and internally generated information is maintained
  in working memory.
