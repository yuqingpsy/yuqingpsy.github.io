abstract: Several recent studies have interpreted multivariate evidence for stimulus-specific
  patterns of activity in parietal and/or frontal cortex as evidence for a representational
  function in those regions that is qualitatively similar to the representational
  functions of the visual system. Here we argue that although evidence that a brain
  system takes on a different configuration for each stimulus in a stimulus set is
  a necessary property for that system having a role in perceptual representation,
  such evidence is not specific for this function. Drawing on several recent examples
  from the recent literature, we offer alternative accounts for understanding stimulus-specificity
  in parietal and frontal cortex that are consistent with longstanding ideas that
  activity these regions is best understood as implementing control-related, rather
  than inherently representational, functions.
