 abstract = {Working memory (WM) requires encoding stimulus identity and context (e.g. where or when stimuli were encountered). To explore the neural bases of the strategic control of context binding in WM, we acquired fMRI while subjects performed delayed recognition of 3 orientation patches presented serially and at different locations. The recognition probe was an orientation patch with a superimposed digit, and pretrial instructions directed subjects to respond according to its location ("location-relevant"), to the ordinal position corresponding to its digit ("order-relevant"), or to just its orientation (relative to all three samples; "context-irrelevant"). Delay period signal in PPC was greater for context-relevant than for "context-irrelevant" trials, and multivariate decoding revealed strong sensitivity to context binding requirements (relevant vs. "irrelevant") and to context domain ("location-" vs. "order-relevant") in both occipital cortex and PPC. At recognition, multivariate inverted encoding modeling revealed markedly different patterns in these 2 regions, suggesting different context-processing functions. In occipital cortex, an active representation of the location of each of the 3 samples was reinstated regardless of the trial type. The pattern in PPC, by contrast, suggested a trial type-dependent filtering of sample information. These results indicate that PPC exerts strategic control over the representation of stimulus context in visual WM.},
